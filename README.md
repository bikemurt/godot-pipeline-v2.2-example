Example project for v2.2 of the Blender-Godot Pipeline Addon.

This project was made with version 3.6 of Blender and version 4.3.dev5.official of Godot.

Blender versions have been tested up to 4.1.

# Includes .blend file

You still need to [download/install the addon separately](https://blendermarket.com/products/blender-godot-pipeline-addon).

If you'd like to try to reproduce the collisions and workflow that I used, the [v22 level_01_blank](https://github.com/bikemurt/godot-pipeline-v2.2-example/tree/main/assets) blend file is available, which does not have any pipeline parameters set.
You can compare with the [v22 level_01](https://github.com/bikemurt/godot-pipeline-v2.2-example/tree/main/assets) file.

Unfortunately this demo does not come close to explaining or showing all of the features of the addon.
Check out other videos from my YouTube channel (more recent = better) for thorough explanations.
